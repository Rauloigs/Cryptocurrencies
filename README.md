# Cryptocurrencies

This projects is about an accounting company offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company doesn't know much about cryptocurrencies. So, I'm using **Unserpervised Machine Learning** to generate a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system, so the accounting company has an idea what to offer to their clients.

To group the cryptocurrencies, you will go over a clustering algorithm and see the outputs on data visualizations.
